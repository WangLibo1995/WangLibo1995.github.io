I received a M.S. degree from [School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering](https://rsgis.whu.edu.cn/), Wuhan University. Currently I am pursuing Ph.D. there. 

I focus on developing advanced AI technologies for remote sensing image analysis. My research interests include computer vision, Vision Transformer, semantic segmentation, building extraction, self-supervised and multimodal learning. I have published 10 papers with [cations 200+](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ywBbW7AAAAAJ) in the remote sensing field, including ISPRS, TGRS, GRSL, RS.
