**Welcome to My Homepage!**

I received a M.S. degree from [School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering](https://rsgis.whu.edu.cn/), Wuhan University. Currently I am pursuing Ph.D. there. 

I focus on using advanced AI technologies to promote the remote sensing image analysis. My research interest includes computer vision, semantic segmentation, transformer, self-supervised and multi-modal learning. I have published more than 5 papers with [cations 70+](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ywBbW7AAAAAJ) in the remote sensing field, such as ISPRS, TGRS, GRSL, RS.
