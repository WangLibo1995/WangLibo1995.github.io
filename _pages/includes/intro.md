**Welcome to My Homepage!**

I received a M.S. degree from [School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering](https://rsgis.whu.edu.cn/), Wuhan University. Currently I am pursuing Ph.D. there. 

I focus on using advanced AI technologies to promote the remote sensing image analysis. My research interest includes computer vision, semantic segmentation, self-supervised learning and multi-modal technology. I have published more than 5 papers in the remote sensing field, such as ISPRS, TGRS, GRSL, RS.
