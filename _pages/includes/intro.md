**Welcome to My Homepage!**

I received a M.S. degree from [School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering](https://rsgis.whu.edu.cn/), Wuhan University. Currently I am pursuing Ph.D. there. 

I focus on using advanced AI technologies to promote the remote sensing image analysis. My research interest includes computer vision, semantic segmentation, self-supervised learning and multi-modal technology. I have published more than 5 papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ywBbW7AAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FWangLibo1995%2Fwanglibo1995.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> in the remote sensing field, such as ISPRS, TGRS, GRSL, RS.
