I received my PhD from [School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering](https://rsgis.whu.edu.cn/), Wuhan University.  

I focus on developing advanced AI technologies for remote sensing image analysis. My research interests include computer vision, Vision Transformer, semantic segmentation, building extraction and multimodal learning. I have published 10 papers with [cations 700+](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ywBbW7AAAAAJ) in the remote sensing field, including ISPRS, TGRS, GRSL, etc.
